Congratulations on successfully clearing the skill test in the first round of our interview process for the Software Engineer role . Your performance in the initial round has impressed us, and we are excited to see your skills shine even further.

In the next stage of our selection process, we have an assessment designed to evaluate your technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. This assessment revolves around developing a Task Management Web Application. Please find the details below:

Project: Task Management Web Application

Project Description
Develop a task management web application where users can create, update, and manage tasks. The application will have both frontend and backend components. Users should be able to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The application should be responsive and user-friendly.

2. Dashboard displaying a list of tasks for the logged-in user.
3. Task creation, editing, and deletion functionality.
4. Filter and sorting options for tasks.
5. User-friendly interface with responsive design.
6. Use of modern frontend technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Backend Requirements
1. RESTful API to handle user authentication (registration and login).
2. API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
3. Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4. Database schema and design to store user information and tasks.
5. Backend logic to handle task filtering and sorting.
6. Use of a backend framework such as Express (Node.js), Django (Python), or Ruby on Rails (Ruby).

Bonus Challenges
1. Implement user roles (admin and regular user) with different permissions.
2. Add due dates and notifications for tasks.
3. Use state management in the frontend (e.g., Redux) for a more organized UI.
4. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.

Evaluation Criteria
1. Code quality: Clear, well-organized, and maintainable code.
2. UI/UX: User-friendly design, responsiveness, and attention to detail.
3. Functionality: Successful implementation of all required features.
4. Security: Proper handling of user authentication and data protection.
5. Technology stack: Effective use of frontend and backend technologies.
6. Problem-solving skills: Ability to tackle challenges and implement advanced features.

Submission and Interview
Please submit your project code by [26th Aug, 6:00PM] along with a README file explaining the setup, features, and any additional notes. Host your code on GitHub and send us the GitHub link of the assessment

The completion of this assessment will qualify you for the next and final stage of our interview process. We look forward to reviewing your project and assessing your capabilities further.
